# Solution Overview

Solution Name: (Required)

# Direct To Market (DTM)

One-line solution summary: (Required)

The DTM allows every creator globally to take ownership, retain majority revenues and gain non-discriminatory access to the global 
market.

# Pitch your solution. (Required)

The DTM is an autonomous, non-discriminatory, global online marketplace.  The DTM allows anyone, who wishes to sell their digital
content, access to the world market.  There are neither corporate ententes nor shareholders to pay. The majority of each sale goes
directly to the content producer instantly.  Creators retain full ownership and are assisted to copyright their material. A level 
playing field for all, intended to interject wealth and stability into all communities on all continents.  So if you are a small 
independent  researcher in Zambia, a documentarian in Korea, a local band in any city that is exhausted and grinding it out for the last
30 years, a young book writer in the Middle East, that one hit wonder with a million dollar song, you now have access to the world 
without giving up control and a majority of the revenue to corporations without your best interest in mind.

# What specific problem are you solving? (Required)
1. The lack of global market access for the majority of the world population. 

2. The lack of income and wealth building opportunities in all communities. 

3. Cultural preservation.  

Digital content is a file or information warehoused or published in a digital format. Digital content can be in many forms, from text 
and audio and video files, to graphic, animation, and images.  Global Digital Content Creation Market valued approximately USD 10.69 
billion in 2017 is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 16.82% over the forecast period 2018-2025.

According to a study published by Midia, global recorded music revenue grew by $1.7 billion in 2017.  This represents an 8.5% increase 
over 2016’s $16 billion.   Yet, Midia made a surprising discovery.  When compared to major label revenue, ‘self-releasing acts’ 
(unsigned artists) collected only $472 million.  Compared to the rest of the major labels, $472 million only constitutes 2.7% of all 
global recording sales. 

Musicians, artists, writers, researchers, film makers exist in all sectors of society.  By developing income opportunities in the 
digital content economy not only does the DTM directly help these content providers, their increased income will enrich and uplift the 
communities around them.

# What is your solution? (Required)
The DTM is comprised of a public global cloud storage, block chain technology, encryption and innovative indexing protocols.  Everything 
is open source and secured through consensus protocols.  The combination of these technologies result in a system that is easy to use 
and inexpensive to maintain.

Digital content is uploaded to the DTM either by the Agent or creator through a web portal.  Price, description, samples and any other
marketing material are added to help advertise. 

Consumers browse content via an application on a phone, PC, tablet or other web enabled device.  When a consumer makes a purchase 
content is delivered encrypted so that it can only be accessed by the intended recipient address.  Revenue from the sale is paid quickly 
and simultaneously to the proper recipients. The creator, the agent and the DTM receive payment directly and in real time.  

By assisting in the registration of copyrights, producers are not only better financially protected but are also better educated on 
modern market practices.  Record keeping is automatically done.  For financial, legal, tax or data analytical purposes, all transaction 
data can be had at the touch of a button.  

A host of new small businesses would support this new economy.

# Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? (Required)
Musicians, Video/Movie/Documentary/TV Producers, Researchers, Writers of all kinds, Podcasters or anyone who produces digital content in
any community in any country.  In addition there are Agents and Agencies, plus a host of other service industries that will be created 
to support the producers. Any community that wants to preserve its culture and share it with the world. (Draft)

# Which of the following categories best describes your solution?
A new application of an existing technology

# Describe what makes your solution innovative.
Block Chain (BC) technology has been called “The Most Important Invention Since the Internet Itself”. The distributed nature of BC makes 
it more stable and secure then current centralized solutions. There are BC solutions currently being applied to securities, land titles, 
voting, finance, supply chain management and the list goes on. We have combined the advantages of BC technology with a distributed cloud 
storage system to create a global digital marketplace that does not require a centralized authority to function. The rules are the same 
for everyone so there is no bias or discrimination. Designed to be a properly regulated capitalist market there are economic incentives 
built into the system to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation. In addition to access to a global market the DTM will bring more 
people in to modern banking, educate people in the use of technology and inspire new innovations.

Our competitors are the centralized corporations that distribute content under the current economic system.  The DTM intends to disrupt
the current system, to create a better, more robust system.  Any and all competitors are encouraged to join the DTM and even leverage 
their current advantages within the rules of the system.  

Technology has reach the point where not only laws and governments can protect the rights of all people but market forces will play a 
growing role in guaranteeing personal freedom.

# Describe the core technology that powers your solution.
The Interplanetary File System (IPFS), https://ipfs.io , makes up the bases of the storage solution.  The DTM creates a double layer 
encrypted storage area within the IPFS where all content is stored. 

The Ravencoin (RVN) Block Chain, https://ravencoin.org , provides several functions in the system.  There are features specific to the 
RVN BC that allow for the delivery of encrypted content to a specific address or entity readable only by the intended receiver.  RVN BC 
also allows for near instant payments and complete transaction record keeping.

The last major component is Open Index Protocol (OIP), https://www.openindexprotocol.com , is an open source specification for a 
persistent worldwide index and file library useful for data publishing, file distribution and facilitating direct payments. OIP uses BC
technology and distributed networking to operate with no central authority: record indexing, file storage/distribution and transaction
management are carried out collectively by the decentralized network.

By combining the functions of each of these systems in innovative ways the DTM delivers content directly and securely to the consumers
while simultaneously delivering the payment funds directly in to the individual accounts of the receiving entities.  No, middle man or
financial institution needed.

# Provide evidence that this technology works.
While there is no demo combining all of the aspects of the DTM at the moment you can use many of the different features now. We use
functions developed by https://www.mangofarmassets.com/ to encrypt and deliver content to consumers. The process is outlined Here: 
https://medium.com/@mangofarm/mango-farms-new-release-is-here-59f1830eff82 . The site is free and everyone is encouraged to use it.

https://ravenland.org and their https://mypin.io/#/ service is what will be used for encryption and storage functions. Ravenland has 
developed some unique uses of IPFS that will be incorporated in to the DTM.

Open Index Protocol (OIP) is an open source specification for a persistent worldwide index and file library useful for data publishing,
file distribution and facilitating direct payments. OIP uses Block Chain technology and distributed networking to operate with no 
central authority: record indexing, file storage/distribution and transaction management are carried out collectively by the 
decentralized network. The system uses a Salutary Protocol model, which creates financial incentive at both the application and protocol 
layers. https://www.alexandria.io/videos .

# What is your theory of change?
1.	Inputs:  The DTM is a Global Online Digital Marketplace, with non discriminatory, low barrier access for content creators.  The DTM
allows creators from anywhere to offer their digital content to the world market thus better monetizing their work while retaining 
ownership and majority revenue. 
2.	Outputs:  Economic incentives built within the DTM encourage entrepreneurship.  An Agent/Agency business model is created to market 
the DTM and service creators.  This new economic model will incentivize a host of support companies in area such as analytics, finance 
and banking, service and management. 
3.	Outcomes:  By having a global marketplace where everyone around the world has the same access and freedoms the direct interjections 
of wealth in to all communities will create sustainable jobs and work to help close the global income gap. 

4.	Evidence:  Quantitative or qualitative data that captures your inputs, outputs, and outcomes and that backs up your view of the 
connections between them.


By creating the tools and access for everyone to use, those with the entrepreneurial spirit will seize upon the opportunity to create an
agency. Those agencies in turn will bring more producers and consumers into the global digital market, thus driving income directly to 
members of all communities. The DTM can increase global economic prosperity from the individual level.

South Korea Russia United Kingdom United States

# In which countries will you be operating within the next year?
Brazil Jamaica Mexico

# How many people does your solution currently serve? How many will it serve in one year? In five years?
The current system is in development and does not server the public in any current manor. 

In one year, after the launch, projections are for between 20,000 and 50,000 consumers and content providers to be active on the DTM.

The 5 year projection would be 1 million to 5 million on the low end.  

There are some plans to expand the DTM in to other areas.  Due to the nature of the system we expect for creative people to start using
the DTM in ways that we can not for tell at this time.  

# What are your goals within the next year and within the next five years?
First goal is to have the code development done and in beta testing by 4th quarter 2020.

There is one agency in active development with a goal of having 10 to 20 agencies setup by the end of 2020.

We are currently working with industry insiders to market the DTM to content providers.   Our goal is to have 250 content provider 
active at time of launch.  We may revise this number upward based on current interest.

In 5 years our goal is to have the foundation fully funded by the operation of the DTM.  To have satellite offices in Central and South
America, Asia, Africa, The Middle East and India to promote agency creations.  We would like to see exponential growth in these areas as
we believe these markets could best benefit from the DTM initially. 

# What barriers currently exist for you to accomplish your goals in the next year and in the next five years?
Our main barrier is funding and man power.  Currently all development is done by unpaid volunteers and a couple of for profit 
corporations that volunteer their resources.  We also have volunteer legal advice at this time.

We are very hesitant about where funding may come from because of our intent to build the DTM and then "Give it away" to the not for 
profit foundation for administration.  Any funding source must understand the core principal of equal economic opportunity for all and 
that there will be no direct profit from the DTM.

A stable source of funding would greatly enhance the development and testing process.

Our other main barrier are cultural barriers to acceptance and use of the DTM.  Many communities are distrustful of outsiders and 
technology.  We have so far be able to overcome this barrier by partnering with individuals from those different communities.  In our
initial test markets we have been over whelmed at the interest in the DTM.  Our "ambassadors" have found a great need for the 
opportunities the DTM provides.  We intend to continue to refine this marketing model and others to better equip future agencies.

# How do you plan to overcome these barriers?
One way we intend to overcome our funding issues is through our marketing and promotion.  With the help of promoters we intend to 
promote events with the proceeds to go toward the development of the DTM.  The can help further our development on several levels.

Funds for the promotions will be razed through event token offerings. This is no different then some current promotional business models
acceptance that BC technology will be employed to track investment ownership and payments. 

The events themselves will be marketing events for the DTM and will add the performers and the attendees to the DTM.

This will spread the interest not only to the content providers and consumers but also to the investment economy about he possibilities 
of the DTM. 

These events also help break down the cultural barriers to acceptance.  

# About Your Team
Edit

# What type of organization is your solution team?
Other, including part of a larger organization (please explain below)

# If you selected Other, please explain here.
Our current team is diversified.  Our main developers are a for profit company that volunteers resources at this time.  These developers
reside in the UK, South Korea and Russia.  Many of the projects they are currently working on would also be incorporated into the DTM. 

Our current marketing development team is headquartered in Tallahassee Florida, USA and has presence in Texas.  

We have several volunteers from the Ravencoin community that lend their skills as they can.

The DTM will ultimately be administered via a not profit foundation.

# How many people work on your solution team?
All work at this time is voluntary.  8 or so people are part time with less than 5 hours devoted to this project.  There are 2 
developers that put many hours a week into projects built on the Ravencoin BC.  Much of this has direct development impact on the DTM. 
There are 2 business developers that put between 15 and 50 hours a week as needed.  

# How many years have you worked on your solution?
The DTM is directly tied to the development of the Ravencoin Block Chain. While the DTM was only conceived of in late 2019 the tools 
that make it possible have been in development by a large community since January 2018.

# Why are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?
On the development side I do not believe there is any other organization that currently works with the underlying technologies on a 
daily basis or has as detailed understanding of how all of them work together as the people working on and the community surrounding 
this project.  On the acceptance and marketing side we are blessed to be working with industry insiders.  They have agreed to work on 
the DTM because they believe in the underlying libertarian principals and the good that can be done.  They understand that the only true
freedom is economic freedom.
