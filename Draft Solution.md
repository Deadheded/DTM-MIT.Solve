# Direct To Market (DTM) 

(a Distributed Trustless Marketplace)

One-line solution summary: (140 characters)

The DTM allows every creator globally to take ownership, retain majority revenues and gain non-discriminatory access to the world
market.

Pitch your solution:

The DTM is a Distributed Trustless Marketplace an autonomous, non-discriminatory, global online marketplace.  The DTM allows anyone who wishes to sell their digital content
access to the world market.  The DTM exists upon globally distributed networks that are supported, not only by the users, but also by
10’s of thousands of other entities that use the distributed networks services for other purposes.  There are neither corporate ententes
nor shareholders to pay so the majority of each sale goes directly to the content producer within an hour of each sale.  Content
producers retain full ownership and are assisted to copyright their material. There is revenue built in for Agents/Agencies, separate
from what the content producers receive.  The system is designed to be a properly regulated capitalist marketplace.  A level playing
field for all, intended to interject wealth and stability into all communities on all continents.  So if you are a small independent 
researcher in Zambia, a documentarian in Korea, a local band in any city that is exhausted and grinding it out for the last 30 years, a 
young book writer in the Middle East, that one hit wonder with a million dollar song, you now have access to the world without giving up
control and a majority of the revenue to some corporation without your best interest in mind.     
 
Film your elevator pitch:

 Any help with this would be great
 
What specific problem are you solving?:

1.	The lack of global market access for the majority of the world population.
2.	The lack of income and wealth building opportunities in all communities.
3. Cultural preservation.
4.	The discrimination and stranglehold maintained by a small number of international corporations on digital content.

Musicians, artists, writers exist in all sectors of society.  By developing income opportunities in the digital content economy 
not only does the DTM directly help these content providers, their increased income will enrich and uplift the communities around them.
 
What is your solution?:

The DTM is the combinations of a public global cloud storage system, block chain technology, encryption technology and some innovative
indexing protocols.  All the software is open source and the system is secured through consensus protocols.  This system addresses and
solves multiple problems on many levels in the current digital content market. I will address some of the major items.

1.	Market access: with very low cost of entry any producer with internet access can offer their content to consumers around the world.

2.	By encouraging the registration of copyrights, producers are not only better financially protected but are also better educated on
modern market practices.

3.	By using the DTM, the producers and consumers bring more modern banking access to their communities.

4.	Not only will content producer and their Agent/Agencies benefit but there will be a host of side industries needed to service them. 
Marketers and promoters, transportation, tour circuits, financial needs and many more.  

5.	Because of the nature of block chain technology record keeping is automatically done.  For financial, legal, tax or data analytical 
purposes, all transactional data can be had at the touch of a button.

6.	Block chain technology also allows for the delivery of encrypted content that can only be accessed by the intended recipient address.
While this does not stop a consumer from downloading, copying and sharing somewhere else, just as if they had purchased a physical music
CD, it does stop account sharing and direct file access sharing. 

7.	Block chain also provides the function of near instant payments.  Revenue from sales is paid directly, quickly and simultaneously to
the proper recipients.

Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives?

Musicians, Video/Movie/Documentary/TV Producers, Researchers, Writers of all kinds, Podcasters or anyone who produces digital content in
any community in any country.  In addition there are Agents and Agencies, plus a host of other service industries that will be created 
to support the producers. Any community that wants to preserve its culture and share it with the world. 

Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?

"The MIT Solve community is looking for technology-based solutions that spur good jobs and inclusive entrepreneurial opportunities. 
To that end, Solve seeks solutions that:"

1. Enable small and new businesses, especially in untapped communities, to prosper and create good jobs through access to capital, 
networks, and technology;

2. Support workers to advocate for and access living wages, social safety nets, and financial security; and

3. Equip workers with technological and digital literacy as well as the durable skills needed to stay apace with the changing job
market.

The DTM has the potential to create more wealth and more jobs for more people in every community around the world than any other
solution.  With a low cost of development and self sustainability the DTM has the ability to drastically improve the lives of hundreds
of millions of people. To this end the DTM directly address all three dimensions of this challange. 

Explain how the problem, your solution, and your solution’s target population relate to the Challenge and your selected dimension.

This question is best answered by explaining the inspirations behind this project.  I recently befriended a bright and interesting
gentleman.  This person plays 23 different musical instruments and since the mid 1970s had played all over the world with a very famous
father.  Yet despite many albums and filling concert halls for decades his father died broke and did not own his music and my friend is
working for a low hourly wage.

This lead me to think about another friend who has been a band leader for the last 30 year, playing clubs and halls with a nice 
following.  She is still working week to week with little to no income security.

How many one hit wonders have we heard about who sell millions of copies but reap very little long term benefit because of the terms and
condition forced upon them by controlling interests.  

A comment was once made by a very established US musician that he received $1.25 per album sale but didn’t care because he was making
5 million dollars a year.  While that system works well if you can sell millions of albums, you might even make a decent living selling 
a few hundred thousand.  But there are 10s of thousands of artist around the globe that could sell 10,000 or more that cannot make a 
living under the current system.  They don’t even have a viable path to reach the global market.  

Every community around the globe has music, art, poetry and litature.  The DTM enables the smallest village to the largest cities.  The
impact cuts accross all sectors of socitey.

With the DTM, all the unnecessary overhead is cut out.  By stripping away the layers of corporate bureaucracy and greed the majority
of the revenue is delivered directly to the content providers and agents.  When a musician is selling 10,000 to 20,000 albums a year 
but receiving $10 per sale they can raise a family, build some wealth and greatly contribute to the economic well being of their 
community.  There is no better way to empower and uplift any community then to give the people the tools they can use to create stable
and sustainable wealth for themselves.  Not only will it enhance physical, mental and financial well being, many studies have shown
that people will use their prosperity to contribute to the betterment of the community around them. 

What is your solution’s stage of development?

Design and early development.  Since the majority of the DTM is contructed from existing open source software sevaral aspects and
functions exits already.  Current development is peliminary and ongoing with a soft target of the first quarter of 2021.

Where is your solution team headquartered?

A distributed team with members in the United States, South Korea, United Kingdom, Russia and a host of vonlenteers that lend what time
and skills they have.

Describe what makes your solution innovative.

Block Chain (BC) technology has been called “The Most Important Invention Since the Internet Itself”.  The distributed nature of BC 
makes it more stable and secure then current centralized solutions.  There are BC solutions currently being applied to securities, land 
titles, voting, finance, supply chain management and the list goes on.  We have combined the advantages of BC technology with a 
distributed cloud storage system to create a global digital marketplace that does not require a centralized authority to function.  The
rules are the same for everyone so there is no bias or discrimination.  Designed to be a properly regulated capitalist market there are
economic incentives built into the system to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation.  In addition to access to a global market the 
DTM will bring more people in to modern banking, educate people in the use of technology and inspire new innovations. 

Describe the core technology that powers your solution.

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS), https://ipfs.io , makes up the bases of the storage solution.  The DTM creates a double layer 
encrypted storage area within the IPFS where all content is stored.  The Ravencoin (RVN) Block Chain, https://ravencoin.org , provides 
several functions in the system.  There are features specific to the RVN BC that allow for the delivery of encrypted content to a
specific address or entity readable only by the intended receiver.  RVN BC also allows for near instant payments and complete 
transactional record keeping.  The last major component is Open Index Protocol (OIP), https://www.openindexprotocol.com , is an open 
source specification for a persistent worldwide index and file library useful for data publishing, file distribution and facilitating 
direct payments. OIP uses BC technology and distributed networking to operate with no central authority: record indexing, file 
storage/distribution and transaction management are carried out collectively by the decentralized network.

Provide evidence that this technology works.

While there is no demo combining all of the aspects of the DTM at the moment you can use many of the different features now.
We use functions developed by https://www.mangofarmassets.com/ to encrypt and deliver content to consumers.  The process is outlined 
here: https://medium.com/@mangofarm/mango-farms-new-release-is-here-59f1830eff82 .  The site is free and everyone is encouraged to use 
it.

https://ravenland.org and their https://mypin.io/#/ service is what will be used for encryption and storage functions. Ravenland has 
developed some unique uses of IPFS that will be incorporated in to the DTM.

Open Index Protocol (OIP) is an open source specification for a persistent worldwide index and file library useful for data publishing,
file distribution and facilitating direct payments. OIP uses Block Chain technology and distributed networking to operate with no 
central authority: record indexing, file storage/distribution and transaction management are carried out collectively by the 
decentralized network. The system uses a Salutary Protocol model, which creates financial incentive at both the application and protocol 
layers. https://www.alexandria.io/videos .

Please select the technologies currently used in your solution:

•	Block Chain technology. https://ravencoin.org/
•	Distributed Cloud Storage. https://ipfs.io/
•	Indexing Protocols. https://www.openindexprotocol.com/
•	End to end encryption.  https://www.openpgp.org 
•	The DTM is be browser agnostic, meaning there may be multiple applications to access and interact with the DTM as a consumer. 
https://www.alexandria.io/ is one interface that can be used. 

What is your theory of change?

By creating the tools and access for everyone to use, those with the entrepreneurial spirit will seize upon the opportunity to create an 
agency.  Those agencies in turn will bring more producers and consumers into the global digital market, thus driving income directly to
members of all communities.  The DTM can increase global economic prosperity from the individual level.

Do you primarily provide products or services directly to individuals, or to other organizations?

Individual producers, consumers and the agent/agencies that support them.

What is your path to financial sustainability?

The current model calls for the DTM to be administered by a not for profit foundation.  The foundation would retain 30% of each sale up
to $3.00 per sale for: 

•	Staffing
•	System maintenance and upgrades
•	Fraud protection
•	Legal issues
•	Marketing 

As the DTM grows the cost per-capita for administration will go down.  The percentage of revenue going to the foundation will be 
evaluated on a timely basis and adjusted downward, with a higher percentage going to the content providers, as financial situations 
allow.  

During the course of developing and marketing the DTM many of those involved have opportunities to build relationships with content 
providers.  Many are leveraging these relationships into Agencies.  The intent is not to make profit directly from the revenue the DTM 
collects but to use the opportunity it provides to build new businesses.  The experienced gained and the business models built by these
initial agencies will be used to market and train other people around the world to create other successful agencies.  These agencies 
will then increase the number of content providers and consumers.

The lack of global market access, income and wealth building opportunities in all communities, cultural preservation and the 
discrimination and stranglehold maintained by a small number of international corporations on digital content.

people in to modern banking, educate people in the use of technology and inspire new innovations.

Our competitors are the centralized corporations that distribute content under the current economic system.  The DTM intends to disrupt
the current system, to create a better, more robust system.  Any and all competitors are encouraged to join the DTM and even leverage
their current advantages within the rules of the system.  

Technology has reach the point where not only laws and governments can protect the rights of all people but market forces will play a 
growing role in guaranteeing personal freedom.

facilitating direct payments. OIP uses BC technology and distributed networking to operate with no central authority: record indexing,
file storage/distribution and transaction management are carried out collectively by the decentralized network.

By combining the functions of each of these systems in innovative ways the DTM delivers content directly and securely to the consumers 
while simultaneously delivering the payment funds directly in to the individual accounts of the receiving entities.  No, middle man or
financial institution needed.

functions developed by https://www.mangofarmassets.com/ to encrypt and deliver content to consumers. The process is outlined Here:

By creating the tools and access for everyone to use, those with the entrepreneurial spirit will seize upon the opportunity to create an
agency. Those agencies in turn will bring more producers and consumers into the global digital market, thus driving income directly to 
members of all communities. The DTM can increase global economic prosperity from the individual level.

The current system is in development and does not server the public in any current manor. 
In one year, after the launch, projections are for between 20,000 and 50,000 consumers and content providers to be active on the DTM.
The 5 year projection would be 1 million to 5 million on the low end.  
There are some plans to expand the DTM in to other areas.  Due to the nature of the system we expect for creative people to start using
the DTM in ways that we can not for tell at this time.  



First goal is to have the code development done and in beta testing by 4th quarter 2020.
There is one agency in active development with a goal of having 10 to 20 agencies setup by the end of 2020.
We are currently working with industry insiders to market the DTM to content providers.   Our goal is to have 250 content provider 
active at time of launch.  We may revise this number upward based on current interest.
In 5 years our goal is to have the foundation fully funded by the operation of the DTM.  To have satellite offices in Central and South 
America, Asia, Africa, The Middle East and India to promote agency creations.  We would like to see exponential growth in these areas as
we believe these markets could best benefit from the DTM initially. 


Our main barrier is funding and man power.  Currently all development is done by unpaid volunteers and a couple of for profit 
corporations that volunteer their resources.  We also have volunteer legal advice at this time.
We are very hesitant about where funding may come from because of our intent to build the DTM and then "Give it away" to the not for 
profit foundation for administration.  Any funding source must understand the core principal of equal economic opportunity for all and 
that there will be no direct profit from the DTM.

A stable source of funding would greatly enhance the development and testing process.

Our other main barrier are cultural barriers to acceptance and use of the DTM.  Many communities are distrustful of outsiders and 
technology.  We have so far be able to overcome this barrier by partnering with individuals from those different communities.  In our 
initial test markets we have been over whelmed at the interest in the DTM.  Our "ambassadors" have found a great need for the 
opportunities the DTM provides.  We intend to continue to refine this marketing model and others to better equip future agencies.


One way we intend to overcome our funding issues is through our marketing and promotion.  With the help of promoters we intend to 
promote events with the proceeds to go toward the development of the DTM.  The can help further our development on several levels.
Funds for the promotions will be razed through event token offerings. This is no different then some current promotional business models 
acceptance that BC technology will be employed to track investment ownership and payments. 

The events themselves will be marketing events for the DTM and will add the performers and the attendees to the DTM.  This will spread
the interest not only to the content providers and consumers but also to the investment economy about he possibilities of the DTM. These 
events also help break down the cultural barriers to acceptance

About Your Team

What type of organization is your solution team?

Other, including part of a larger organization (please explain below)

If you selected Other, please explain here.

Our team is diversified.  Our current developers are a for profit company that volunteers resources at this time.  These developers 
reside in the UK, South Korea and Russia.  Many of the projects they are currently working on would be incorporated into the DTM. 
Current marketing development team is headquartered in Tallahassee Florida, USA and has presence in Texas.  We have several volunteers
from the Ravencoin community that lend their skills as they can.

How many people work on your solution team?

How many years have you worked on your solution?

The DTM is directly tied to the development of the  Ravencoin Block Chain.  While the DTM was only conceived of in late 2019 the tools 
that make it possible have been in development by a large community since January 2018.

Why are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?

On the development side I do not believe there is any other organization that currently works with the underlying technologies on a
daily basis or has as detailed understanding of how all of them work together as the people working on and the community surrounding 
this project.  On the acceptance and marketing side we are blessed to be working with industry insiders.  They have agreed to work on
the DTM because they believe in the underlying libertarian principals and the good that can be done.  They understand that the only true
freedom is economic freedom.
