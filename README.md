MIT SOLVE Challenge

This repository is for collaboration on a submission to the MIT Solve challenge. 

https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/good-jobs-and-inclusive-entrepreneurship

The target date is the 31st of March, 2020 to finish this submission.

Please feel free to add suggestions or addition or start a new branch.

This submission involves an online marketplace designed from a combination of the Ravencoin (RVN) Block Chain and 
the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).

Great thanks must be given to @Mangofarms and @Push | Ravenland.org. This project is combination of the excellent 2nd layer work 
they have done.

Also, it must not be taken lightly the contributions of @Tron, @Blondfrogs, @BruceFenton, PB and a very long list of visionary 
people that produced the ideas and the tools to make all of this possible.

Last, and probably the most important, our Community. It is a very rare thing to have this size and kind of collaboration simply from
people's hope and principals. None of this would be more than some nerds sitting in an office if it were not for the volunteer work done
by everyone here.

Thank you all
