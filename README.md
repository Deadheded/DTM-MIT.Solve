# DTM-MIT.Solve
This repository is for collaboration on a submission to the MIT Solve challenge.
https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/good-jobs-and-inclusive-entrepreneurship

The target date is the 31st of March, 2020 to finish this submission.

This submission involves an online marketplace designed from a combination of the 
Ravencoin (RVN) Block Chain and the Interplanatary File System (IPFS).

Great thanks must be Given to @Mangofarms and @Push | Ravenland.org.  This project is 
combination of the excelent 2nd layer work they have done.

Also, it must not be taken lightly the controbutions of @Tron, @Blondfrogs, @BruceFenton, 
PB and a very long list of visionary people that produced the ideas and the tools to make
all of this possible. 

Last and probabally the most important, our Community.  It is a very rare thing to have 
this size and kind of collaboration simply from people's hope and principals.  None of 
this would be more than some neards sitting in an office if it were not for the volenteer
work done by everyone here.

Thank you all
